= Block Rotation

== Introduction

SKALE Chain Block rotation allows to limit the space on hard drive which is occupied by blocks. The current default value is 12.6GB.

Each SKALE Chain maintains a minimum to maximum number of blocks, which are 80% and 100% of the above value respectively.

Rotation is performed across 4 databases. Each database contains:

* blocks
* transactions and their receipts
* log blooms
* "best" (lastBlockHash, best block of the canonical chain)
* "chainStart" (firstBlockHash, used when full chain isn't available, for example after snapshot import)
